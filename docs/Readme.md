REfer karo startup idea

28-01-2026
✅ What We Did Today
1️⃣ Clarified the Core Startup Idea
    • Defined ReferKaro as a referral marketplace
    • Clearly separated:
        ○ Client 1: Employees willing to refer
        ○ Client 2: Job seekers
    • Locked the deposit + proof + payout model

9️⃣ **The Core Solution: "Proxy Email" Verification (The Trust Protocol)**
    *   **The Problem:** How do we prove the employee actually sent the referral?
    *   **The Fix:** We sit in the middle.
        1.  User applies on ReferKaro → We generate a unique proxy email (e.g., `savio.x9z@referkaro.com`).
        2.  Employee refers *that* proxy email in their portal.
        3.  Company sends "Complete Application" link to the proxy email.
        4.  **VERIFICATION SUCCESS:** Our system detects the incoming mail. We verify the referral *automatically*.
        5.  We forward the link to the Candidate's real email.
        6.  Candidate handles the interview; ReferKaro acts as the permanent email relay (protecting privacy & logging progress).

2️⃣ Structured the Business Model
    • ₹1000 refundable deposit per shortlisted candidate
    • Revenue split:
        ○ 50% → Employee
        ○ 20% → Job seeker
        ○ 30% → Platform
    • Clarified that payment is for referral effort, not job guarantee

3️⃣ Identified the Real Problem
    • Cold applications don’t work
    • Referrals dramatically improve chances
    • Current referral process is:
        ○ Informal
        ○ Unreliable
        ○ No accountability

4️⃣ Analyzed Competition
    • Looked at similar platforms
    • Identified key gap:
        ○ No escrow
        ○ No proof verification
        ○ No aligned incentives
    • Positioned ReferKaro’s unique advantage
    Most platforms:
        • Reward only referrers (or nobody)
        • Ignore candidate behavior
        • Platform has no skin in the game
    ReferKaro:
        • Employee earns → motivated to refer properly
        • Candidate gets cashback → stays honest
        • Platform earns only when referral happens
    👉 All three win only when the system works.
    This alignment is rare and powerful.
    

5️⃣ Surfaced Risks & Limitations (Important)
    • Company policy conflicts
    • Trust issues with upfront payment
    • Fraud & fake proofs
    • Cold-start marketplace problem

6️⃣ Designed Mitigation Strategies
    • Refundable deposits
    • Manual verification early
    • Clear disclaimers
    • Start with limited industries

7️⃣ Defined MVP & Build Strategy
    • MVP features listed
    • Phased build plan (manual → automated)
    • Suggested tech stack
    • AI-assisted development approach

8️⃣ Created an Investor Pitch Deck
    • Full detailed deck (extended version)
    • Investor-ready framing
    • Included risks, vision, GTM, legal setup

9️⃣ Covered Legal & Registration Basics (India)
    • Private Limited company
    • PAN, TAN, GST
    • Payment & compliance considerations

🔟 Created a Word Doc
    • Consolidated everything discussed
    • Ready for sharing with co-founders, mentors, investors

🚀 What To Do Tomorrow (High-Impact, Realistic)
🧠 1️⃣️⃣ Validate the Idea (MOST IMPORTANT)
Talk to real people:
    • 5–10 job seekers
    • 5–10 employees in tech/startups
Ask:
    • Would you pay ₹1000 for a guaranteed referral attempt?
    • What roles are hardest to get referrals for?
    • What scares you about this idea?
👉 No code until this is done

🧱 2️⃣️⃣ Lock the MVP Scope
Decide what NOT to build:
    • Web-only (no app yet)
    • Manual verification
    • No automation initially
Outcome:
    • 1-page MVP feature list

⚖️ 3️⃣ Pressure-Test the Risky Parts
    • Company policy risk → which companies are safest?
    • Payment psychology → is ₹1000 too high?
    • Trust → what proof feels “enough”?

📐 4️⃣️⃣ Simplify the Pitch
    • Convert the long deck into a 7–8 slide version
    • One clear narrative:
“We monetize referral intent, not hiring outcomes”

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 5️⃣️⃣ Start Thinking About a Co-Founder (Optional)
Ask yourself:
    • Do I need a tech co-founder?
    • Can I ship MVP myself with AI tools?
    • What skills am I missing?

📝 6️⃣️⃣ Write Down Assumptions
Create a simple list:
    • Users will pay small amount (₹99) for Tokens (Commitment).
    • Users will pay large amount (₹900) for Success (Value).
    • Proof can be verified
These become your validation checklist.
